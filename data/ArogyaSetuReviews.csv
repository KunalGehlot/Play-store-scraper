arun kumar,"November 22, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,1032,"Useless app, don't give real time update when we are at a crowded place. It was claimed that it will give you alerts but it doesn't happen. It gives update after 3 days that you came in contact. I use to check the number of cases rising everyday but now they are not updating that information also."
K s,"December 16, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,15,"Please remove the scrolling text in your covid people radius section. its an irritative feature of slow scrolling. Instead of Unnecessary news and large size labels, highlight ""how many people near you are covid positive"" in big sized text. You highlighted unnecessary things in big text size and necessary things in small text size with unneeded scrolling."
hoshaiah reddy,"December 7, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,189,"It was fine in the beginning. Now it automatically deactivates and asks for registration. In the process, it's halting at ""aarogyasetu app wants to make your phone visible to other bluetooth devices for 120 sec"" whether we accept or deny it does not proceed further. I Uninstalled and reinstalled several times but no remedy."
Nallasivan Govindasamy,"November 23, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,333,"ZERO RATING. I never get any alerts from this app even though I had covid affected neighbors. The worst thing is that I got COVID-19 and I have updated my status in the app. I used my another phone and checked whether it alerts or not. Not even a single alert. This application is purely for data collection and not for helping people. Please don't reply like ""WE ARE EXTREMELY SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE"" kind of automated replies. I don't want any from you"
Aayush Agrawal,"December 11, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,65,"Deceased and recovered graphs are not visible due to use of incorrect colour combination. I mentioned coughing and it is showing me at high risk. I could be having common cold or dust alergy, corresponding options are not there. If I have already got tested, There should be a way to update test ID or SRF no and app should pull results from there. People will lie on test if incomplete options provided. Incomplete app, not reliable. it's been developed so quickly, but not improved for accuracy."
Gaurav Sehgal,"December 13, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,117,"From last 2 months, my aap status is showing Covid +ive. This status came up suddently one day, and I have not undergone any prior testing as well. Not sure who maintains this app and how they mark the +ive status on an specifc mobile number. Looks like there is a complete unorganised structure behind, who is maintaining this app and because of that common people are suffering. For me this app is of no use, but is a annoying thing to have."
MOHAMMED Ali,"October 31, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,976,"Totally useless app. If it has real time data on positive patients and their location, with my Bluetooth always on I expect that it warns me when I am in the vicinity. It does not. Moreover, now that I have 2 next door, it has no clue, it does not show them. It caused undue stress on me telling me I am at risk, two days after I may have crossed someone in a busy intersection. It is simply, ineffective, useless. I am not removing it only because some places want to check it."
Manjul Kumar,"November 19, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,111,Very poor app. Even after more than half an hour the app cannot provide following information and displaying fetching fetching fetching... 1. Fetching nearby covid19 cases but unable to provide information. 2. Fetching Covid19 Testing Laboratories but unable to display any information. 3. Fetching COVID-19 care hospitals but again cannot display any information. I think app is made only for inauguration purpose not for lateron uses. I don't have any network issue.
Sabyasachi Chatterjee,"October 13, 2020",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,2104,"App is fine. But sometimes , after it updates, it logs you out , and you have to ""re-register"". This is inconvenient. Moreover, the app should continuously prompt, when bluetooth is switched off. This way, people around will be safe. Also, the app should start giving a siren alert or vibrate, if you come near someone with ""unsafe"" stat on the app."
Manish Lalwani,"November 28, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,13,"In the Covid Updates graphic representation, Daily Deceased and Daily Recovery options are not shown clearly.. The chart is only showing in cumulative basis and Daily basis format should be made properly visible.. Please look into this because I usually have a look on it and from last update, it is disappeared.. Please resolve at the earliest."
Nikhil Sinha,"December 13, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,5,"For the last 30 days or so, I have the same 2-3 contacts. It looks like the app does not connect to new people any more! EDIT: Yes, it works now. But for almost a month, it was not working. EDIT #2: Does not work at all!"
D Parmar,"November 30, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,95,Installed from early on. Haven't seen any alerts on cases nearby. Why does this app need Bluetooth to be on at all times? Bluetooth uses up more battery life. And notifications are not able to be cleared. Poorly designed app. India has some of the best programmers and yet govt apps and websites are so poorly designed.
Amrita singh,"November 8, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,2071,"This app is useless, and its because it doesn't know the condition of people. Like imagine you have to go to a crowded place for some reason, and when you scan, it shows that it does not know the condition of some 100 or 200 persons, I have installed this on my device only because we can't get entry on some places without it, just a formality. Tottaly useless."
Johnson P,"October 20, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,375,"There is no change in opinion. In fact it is growing worse. I asked some of my friends and a number friends opinioned that they installed it under compulsion but not at all using it. Now, there's a covid case adjacent to my house. But the app shows that no positive case within 1 km using the app. This is the true picture of the app. Those who says app is fine tells you only just that, but utility wise its zero."
Astha Gupta,"December 10, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,5,Worst app. No update or notification for recent contacts. It just show high risk of infection all the time when u feed some symptoms nothing else. I don't understand why the hell government developed it.. when it was of no use for public. It just shows stats of covid.. which anyone can check on google or websites.
NAGESH PUTTASWAMY,"November 28, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,53,It gives one tension when it says you were in close proximity of infected/high risk person it could also give a warning like a beep or a msg so that one ca be more careful. I have it on 2 devices which always be together with me. Each one of them show different information on contact numbers are quite high like 20 in one 27 in other. Both are always on both has internet on always & blue tooth. They will on me together in one pocket.
Mahendra Pratap Singh,"November 17, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,2023,Simply only one thing i can say is that it is a useless app. It can not even warn the user that he/ she is close to the positive patients or sensitive areas. Even if the user wants to know then also it gives a message that the status of close contacts will be updated after 3 hours. I think the developer is interested in data collection only and not in checking spread of covid19.
suraj gulati,"December 3, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,74,"From last 10 to 14 days app has stopped sensing users which comes in bluetooth proximity, as it's now not showing data to be updated to server and number of proximity count is decreasing day to day. while working in busy work environment and aftera reinstalling app,status is still same, app is not able to discover other aarogya setu app users through bluetooth proximity. Also same status with other aarogya setu app being used in other phone. So please check."

Manu Mishra,"September 25, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,540,I was using the older version of this and I didn't find any problem while registering my mobile number. But when I updated my app in the newer version the app is not taking my mobile number to get registered. I am using one plus 7 mobile phone and the same mobile I have been using for the older version too. Can anyone please suggest me what to be done to resolve this issue.
Saumya Chauhan,"November 25, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,20,I can't log in. I have to travel tomorrow. It is an URGENT MATTER! It's showing an ERROR! I did as was asked. I deleted the app cache. I have also uninstalled and reinstalled the application. I emailed the screenshot of the app showing the error. I also wrote my phone model number and Android version. I updated the software and retried as well. This app is still not logging me in. PLEASE RESOLVE MY ISSUE ASAP. I HAVE TO TRAVEL TOMORROW.
anuraj,"December 8, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,82,"Every time i open this app after some days its automatically logout.every time we need to login. Before 2 month 4 person i contacted had corona ,but i didn't get any alerts or any notification. i just scan my recent contact details at that time its showing some of the contact person had corona.but i didn't get any alert or anything"
suman ghosh,"November 22, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,150,"Not so good fully its useless. Only its use to watch daily covid report. But its not work properly today(date-22/11/2020). I want to give it 0 star but its out of option. The app saw us ""you are safe or high risk "" it is fully based on assess. Very bad and useless, and the app always tell us to on our bluetooth. Very bad 🖓🖓🖓🖓"
Sankarasubramanian subbier,"November 27, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,77,"Very good. As long as the other person has a mobile with this app, enabled with blue tooth and location. Surprised to read reviews without knowing this essential need. When I had to accompany my brother to a hospital during Oct 2020 to meet a nuro surgeon, it has caputured one infected person's presense somewhere around. Disappeared a few weeks latter, may be after a specific weeks or so. I am impressed. Every alternate day I assess myself for MY safety."
Neelesh Chatterjee,"December 9, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,19,You should add one option by which we can see our own covid 19 test report also by entering own contact number through otp services verification.you are sending the covid test based sms but if one time phones are formatted then no sms link will be in phone anyway. But if we can see the result in this app that woukd be best for us. Include the service in arogya setu app.
RAJKUMAR,"September 23, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,226,"There is some technical glitch in locating/Position capturing procedure/programming of this App . On 13 September 2020 , I was only at Kolkata airport but as per this app , My position was traced both at Kolkata & Delhi airports in a time span of 30 minute which is practically not possible. So I am not 100% sure that data provided by this app for you is reliable. Developer, Please take corrective measures. Thanks. FYI App version 1.4.1 & Android version 9 , Phone model Honor 7X."
Trupti Satish Kadni,"September 19, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,171,"Worst experience ever! I am advised to reinstall the app and the minute I do that, apparently my phone number is not valid and I don't get further OTPs. This is such a hassle. Everywhere the app doesn't work, I have to write an endless declaration. I declare that your app is the culprit here! Fix the issues please."
Ratnakumar Vattiprolu,"October 7, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,436,"Totally useless app, no consistency in database showing in this. I had Covid and discharged from hospital, after one month of discharging from hospital now it is showing I am a Covid patient. There is no provision given to self update. Help line also not useful for such problems. No provision given to contact right person to correct the errors."
Donny Peter,"December 11, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,"I had to install it on the insistence by airport security. I uninstalled it at the earliest I could. Recently even judges are asking convicts on bail to install this app. I don't buy the justification from the app developers that the app needs to be used for the good of my family. Let me freely choose, if you still agree to the concept of free will of a law abiding citizen. Don't use your CISF muscle power to get me install it and use it."
Vikash Kumar Gupta,"October 11, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,404,"Just rating high for creating this app. However there are many points which needs to be taken care within the app. 1. Opening Loading time is too high. Ideally it should be done within 3s but it takes minutes in a 200MBPs connection. 2. It is not showing the distance wise stats as observed on today - 11.10.20 3. The native back button does back the screen, it exits the app. Atleast it should warn and say double back for exit if user is already in home page. 4. Data upload takes more time in mins"
Dhupkar Milind,"November 23, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,12,"Great app. Gives health status of contacts and if anyone was risky. Good for tracking progress of disease statewise. Issue -- on my Samsung Android phone, colors of daily graph are not visible. Also you can also give statistics for metro cities."
Ravi Kumar Reddy Bandi,"October 30, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,167,"Not at all usefull, it isn't a dynamic app which let the user know if he/she is close vicinity of a Covid positive patient, one has to manually update each and every time, even then it doesn't show the true info. I somehow have to believe now that it's just a gimmick or publicity stunt or mere show-off kind of thing that the govt is doing great in tracing the infected people which is a big false"
Makarand Joshi,"November 24, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,0,"Unable to login - with the recent software update on my phone, the app which was already in use by me for more than 6 months, is now not responding. I reinstalled the app and despite giving it all the necessary permissions, it's not logging me in. Please resolve as I need to undertake domestic travel shortly."
Rina Das,"November 13, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,114,"Suddenly today it showed that the update of this app has been updated in my mobile, but on checking the update I found I had to register again. But when I gave my mobile number, then it said otp was sent but no opt was sent. So, I tried again. But then when I gave my mobile number again, it displayed -- ''There is some error logging you in."" Now please tell me what to do."
Yogesh Marwaha,"September 22, 2020",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,139,"First of all the concept of the application is great, but even though the Application was able to identify when my father had contact with a covid positive person (why that person was roaming around, is a mystery), but it either didn't notify or didn't notify with much stress, since by the time we checked the application, it was too late."
AVINASH KUMAR,"December 5, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,1,"Useless app, By this app. We can't get more alertness as we were suggested that if a positive comes near with me then it will start to ring or vibrate or anything. Only we can get data about patients."
Tanishq Agarwal,"November 15, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,451,"The app is nice but requires some updates.It uses bluetooth to determine your location but this is not successful.It should use GPS for the same.If you are going to your office, then it uses your office's location and doesn't change it after you have left the place.A COVID positive patient is just living adjacent to my house, still it shows ""YOU ARE SAFE"".If you want India to be free from Corona, then please fix these issues."
Srishyla. D Vedantha,"November 26, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,96,Here is the proof that this app does not work: I stay about 500 metres from a hospital where covid patients are being treated. The shows that there is one (1) person infected with covid19 within 1KM when the hospital has substantial number of patients being treated. Apps such as this will not work with runaway cases. Edit1: It appears that the reviews receive stock responses by the developer. Pathetic.
Umang Kagathara,"October 6, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,645,"There is some error logging you in. How would I know what error. If you want to fight covid in such a populous country, the application must be bug free. Else you will loose data as a part of population will not install the app. I was able to login before but a few days back it started to show me 403 forbidden, I cleared the data, even reinstalled the app but now it is not bale to log me in."
Aloke Ekka,"September 24, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,188,"The app only tells about the basic information that is available on the internet elsewhere. There is no real-time monitoring and accuracy is far beyond. Further, I suspect the app is basically data collection malware. Not saying the app isn't secure but saying the app itself might be malicious. As after installing and entering my mobile number for registration I started getting multiple spam calls for donations, loans, credit cards, etc. which were very rare (2-3 a month and now 4-5 per day). So, I suppose the app itself is selling user data. But since the app is mandatory for commuting I have it installed. Otherwise I would strictly advise to stay away from it and if installed force stop it from running in background. Don't know what all data it might be collecting and selling."
Varun N,"September 26, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,121,"Not able to log in - ""some error while logging in"", don't know what to do differently. Have tried clearing cache and uninstall-reinstall multiple times in past 24 hours. Contacted support team but didnt get a response beyond the ususal clear cache. Terrible Edit: I have been sending the emails and feedback a few times innpast 24 hours now, can you please review and respond ?"
Nabajyoti Kalita,"December 3, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,43,"Useless app.... Just for showcase purpose.... 3 weeks back when I was suffering from COVID-19, this app was showing me ""Safe"" even if aadhaar card details were taken during testing. When I have myself updated my status as Covid-19 positive, then also it was showing me as ""Safe"". Now after recovering from Covid-19, then also it is showing ""Safe"". It means in all cases you are ''Safe"". Great joke."
Anirban Roy,"November 19, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,4,"Facts and figures are itself not correct, if so, after tested negetive, status should have automatically changed to green. Last comment: The app shows Incorrect status, even after tested negative, it shows covid positive.. after sharing required details through email to support team, it got corrected. Process should be automated i.e. if it turns red automatically once tested positive, should be green once tested negetive without any manual intervention of user through mail exchanges."
Radhakrishnan Pariyarath,"September 28, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,398,"Though it's a good initiative. I haven't found it very useful. Iam in a building where a COVID19 patient expired and two of the relatives are found positive and are shifted to hospital. The app uses the GPS but doesn't give any alert at all. I can't understand the usefulness of it at all.. The app also drains the mobile battery as it uses Bluetooth and GPS.. 28/9/20: My 2nd review after I turned positive, Showed + only after I send a mail. Now the App shows you are safe without me getting tested"
Siraj Mansuri,"December 1, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,7,"I don't know how this app is saving us where you can only see the numbers of positive or negative. But there isn't any another option that any covid positive is near you withing 5 to 10 mtr and it is not notifying us that ""stay alert a person near you is covid positive."""
Sanjay Dubey,"December 1, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,4,Now this app became worst because after updating this app and when I opened it ask me information. After filling up all information I clicked on submit option and then it stucks... Nothing is coming after clicking on submitting option. Please fix this problem otherwise the app will be uninstalled. Thank you!
sasi kala,"October 17, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,198,"Im afraid this app is not passing on right message in one case noticed. Though a person is international traveller and don't have any covid symptoms still, it displays a message that person is considered as 'Unwell' or 'Risk' and asking for confirmation by the person. I would suggest that, app shows the person is under quarantine instead of saying 'Risk' or 'Unwell'. Thank you for considering the feedback."
Aqua`,"September 20, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,234,"Excellent app. Doesn't ask for any unnecessary permissions, so I don't think my privacy is comprised, like the rumours have it. However the app itself is not that useful because hardly anyone has installed it around me. Still, atleast some have and that's the only reason I use it. Please keep up the good work and update other apps and websites too."
Abhijit Biswas,"November 22, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,1,"This app is absolutely rubbish. I was in a covid hospital with infection and yet i was safe. I walk 15 mins to my office with no people around and I'm moderate to high rate of infection! Absolutely pointless and then it says i met someone infected 10+ days ago, it's amazing!"
ajay chintu,"December 9, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,12,"This is the worst app,I know some covid patients nearby leaving few meters away but this app does not show any covid patients nearby and saying that there were no covid patients till 1 km,this app does not contain all the data and don't believe that this app works perfectly on covid 19,people need to know information through other people contactless only, don't think that people are safe whatever this app says and don't keep yourself at risk as this app doesn't contain all the data about covid"
Ankit Prasad,"September 25, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,24,"The initial idea for contact tracing may have been good, but the implementation of the app is a huge failure. It does not provide real time tracing capabilities and instead just causes panic. Also, forcing it down everyone's throat by making it mandatory in many places is a huge turn-off."
ashwini sankhala,"September 30, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,4,"I have an idea for a feature that you can add this app. As recently we see that a 19 year old girl is raped and no action is taken against that. So , you can add an alert button to your app that a girl can use when she feel unsafe , when the girl click that button an alert message will be send to the other user of this app which are in range of 1 km that "" this user is unsafe & also the Live location of that girl"".... please think on this ....we want rape free India🇮🇳 Please reply me back 🙏"
Bhadresh Modi,"November 25, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,2,Application is the best but when user himself is covid-19 positive how it can be entered? There should be some arrangements. Also I got admission in hospital so all my nearby patients should come under survilence of the application as my Bluetooth is always on. So lots of improvement is required to make it world class.
Arkaprovo Chakrabarty,"November 8, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,98,"Not worth it. Basically it is suppose to trace all Covid contacts, cases history automatically by connecting all hospital, test centres and voluntary disclosure. Mobile numbers should be directly fed into app. However it doesn't. One of my close relative got infected, hospitalized, discharged, stays next door does not show up. Other multiple cases around next door upper floors, but it shows I am safe. It does not show correctly when I faced practical situation. Not helpful, worthless function."
MUHAMMED IRSHAD P.T,"November 8, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,301,"The app shows covid positive after getting the test results as negative for last 14 days. What a useless app. Deleting the account does nothing, I thought it will ask questions again if the latest results are positive or negative, but that's not the case. Why make use of technology if this also will be slow as any other government work"
kedarvk,"September 26, 2020",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,108,"One place to get all the data. But, the data is updated very late. Also, the color of daily recovered and deaths is not good. Both the background and the bars color is same. Not sure why such basic thing has not been rectified for so many days. The color combination is good for confirmed and active cases."
Ravinder Reddy,"September 28, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,9,Not at all helpful. it doesn't even show people who are suffering with covid. its just prime minister mandatory to download the arogya setu app. while traveling in train or plane at railway station or airport the app doesn't track any people suffering with covid. the app only drains the mobile battery when access is given to location and blue tooth usage to track covid positive people. its a useless app arogya setu.
SACHIN Deshmukh,"November 27, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,37,"This app shows incorrect number on contacted people in proximity and 100% of their status shows as unknown for 30days, so what's the use??? And how I'm I protected from risk out side??? Patients mobile number data must be linked to this app at the time of hospitalisation/testing only and kept as alert for next 21 days, then this may be little useful, else real cause of designing this app cannt be achieved. Think it wisely"
gourav singh Rajawat,"November 23, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,2,"Worst app, I am not able to login, it's continuosly shows ""There is some error in logging in you"", and there is no helpdesk for solving any issues. mailed to given mail , still not able to login."
Rahul das,"September 22, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,150,"I have downloaded it 10 or 15 times.. after downloading, i enter the required data, but it doesn't show me the status page.. it just get stucked in that data page only..and i have no problem, no root in my device..if it has any bugs..please fix it!!! I have done everything..in terms of clearing data and cache..nothing is working"
Rajeshwar Shende,"September 22, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,6,"Very bad experience. When there is any error you please show why it failed? If this app is so important for government then the support and mitigation of issues should also be the responsibility. When user is stuck at some point, it's a dead lock and user is left with no options. Very disgusting app."
akhil birdi,"November 30, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,5,Full of bugs and issues. Despite the fact that I am not infected still shows infected. If you are in a radius of other infected person of 1km and still shows infected then I think it needs to be worked again. Don't use illogical fundas here
Linda Rodrigues,"December 16, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,"Very bad, when I fill in my mobile number, its says ""error occured"" cannot log in. Tried so many many times but the same message comes up. And I'm travelling tomorrow HELP!!!!!"
Payal Shukla,"November 3, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,110,"Worst app... The contact tracing on the app is very poor. When a person one floor above my apartment was diagnosed covid positive and was under home treatment only, the status showed you're safe and now it's caught some bluetooth(god only knows which, as I don't move out of the house or the compound of my locality.. where no covid positive exsist in present date) n the status shows moderate risk of infection.. it's pathetic.. waste..rather I would say it's of no use app with zero reliability."
Dr d,"November 17, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,9,Its based on the concept that if you have your location on all the time and others users have their location on all the time then if some user gets tested positive within a few days then the app tells you that you were in close proximity with them.
Kunal Arya Vlogs,"September 20, 2020",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,19,"Really good application for self assessment but there were a lag problem I'm facing since last week... Whenever I tried to self assessment then it always lags in my phone and without any self assessment it says send your self assessed data to health ministery office to inform that you are covid-19 possitive patient and at first I'm saying I haven't travelled internationally, nationally, and locally then there were not a chance that I get infected from covid-19."
Saumya Singla,"September 23, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,109,The app is good but Has errors. From the past 10 days it's showing we can not evaluate your risk status. I've reinstalled the app but same problem arises. Also it shows that 4 cases have been reported in my 1km area but in actual more than 10 cases have been reported in past 14 days. So the app isn't appropriate
Ganesh Sridharan,"November 11, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,152,"1). I installed this app may be in March or April. But after some weeks , uninstalled due to its poor performance. Again installed yesterdy to find improvements. But I could not register my mobile number. My mobile is Samsung Galaxy A30. Using Vi network. 2). Got notification today to update the version.

Sanjana Roy,"November 7, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,13,"A brilliant app, people those who think the this app in not good even ,1% are fool. Absolutely if you are not seeing and contact near you although he is near he could only be seen if his Bluetooth and location service is enable, if you can see high risk of infection and got tested than you have to re access such fools are in india. I didn't know ! It will only warn you after being close to an infective person if the person also have the Aarogya setu app."
supreet joshi,"September 19, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,6,Not useful. I have taken test and my Covid test is negative. It didn't alert me when I was in proximity as per the app 10 days before. Now I have to travel back home. Just because of some bluetooth data my status is showing Moderate risk. I am doubtful I will be allowed entry at airport now.
Alpesh Shah,"September 27, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,3,I installed to see if there are any active covid cases in my nearby area but it doesn't show such thing. If there are cases in my area then why should app wait till I actually come in contact of person. By indicating number of cases near by 500m one would be more cautious while coming out of home nevertheless objective is everyone remains cautious and stay at home and does not panic.
Anamika Pathak,"September 28, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,266,"It can't help in tracking infection for a number of reasons. 1) Not everyone carries their phone with them all the time. 2) If everyone isn't registered it may not work. 3) The questionnaire is outdated and not sufficient to asses risks. Nevertheless, good initiative from the government but as all other government initiatives, it is just useless."
Pradnya Malawade,"October 18, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,72,"Using this App from past 6 months. The contact tracking status is showing that only one contact is nearby. This is inspite going out for any imp work. For the family member coming with me , the app data shows updated infor but not for me. No improvement even after using uninstall n reinstall option. Can the concern dept look into it and suggest the exact resolution"
Akshay Parikh,"November 23, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,"Not useful.Has graphs of how many infected, dead, recovered etc. These things are avaliable in news also. I had to install forcibly as many places they ask you to show the app icon before entry."
Satya_narayana P,"December 2, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,24,"Arogya setu app doesn't work correctly with some mobiles/ numbers. 1) I came in contact with covid19 positive few times in office but the app has not shown any risk ever. Always showed as safe and green colour. 2) on 24.11.2020 myself tested covid19 positive by Delhi health care department. Further, I had submitted about tested positive in my mobile app, even then the app shows to me as safe and green. Even My contacts did not get their status risk on my positive test. - Satyanarayana, Delhi."
SPIPL-Alok Kumar Mukherjee,"September 22, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,5,Useless app. Hardly any one keeps their mobile bluetooh always on. I am right now infected positive and already under medical treatment but it does not tell. This is worst development i ever found. It should be automatically linked with practical gps and mobile number not dependant on blutooth and manual update from each person.
Avinash Sagar,"September 22, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,2,It is not installing properly. Several times downloaded but worked none of the times. It should have been designed in such a way that even a lay man can access it entirely. I hope that my note pointed out will be taken seriously.
rupa reddy,"September 26, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,2,"I have been trying to install the app since more than 24 hrs, but it just keeps saying that ""app can't be stopped"" It baffles me that this is happening with an app that is considered essential for travel at times like this! Please fix the bug immediately 🙏"
SHARAD JOSHI,"September 27, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,20,"Waste of time. Everytime at the time of registration, it sends OTP but says login failed try again. Tried at least 30/40 times but couldn't enter into it. It is working exactly as Government employee. Rating is must before writing review, hence have to give 1 star. Otherwise it is eligible for 0 or negative rating."
VIRAJ MEHTA,"November 29, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,2,I never got any alerts from this application even though I had covid affected neighbours. The worst thing is that I got COVID-19 infection and the application shows that Im safe. I guess this application is just for data collection and there is no other motive of this application.
Vishal Verma,"November 24, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,1,"Authentication of this is in doubt, how many persons rigorously using this app and keeping it updated, many a times I've been in contact of many persons but it always shown fewer people in my radar. Also the person becoming positive not shown in this app at times."
karthik ramamurthy,"October 23, 2020",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,63,"A very useful app, but from 1 full month it has never asked me to upload data onto the server, I made it a point to open the app and check status of recent contacts atleast once a day.

Shova Das,"November 29, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,1,"District wise statistics should be maintained. Test centers and Treatment centers must be provided district wise, it is difficult to search through the whole state."
Akash Singh,"December 12, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,56,Veey good experience. But people are not aware that it does not automatically show if there's any +ve person nearby you or not unless the same person should need to fillup the required details with true fact eg. if someone has came in contact with any of the COVID patients then he/she must have to admit else the information will be wrong and it'll never indicate to others.

Ananya Kesharwani,"November 30, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,15,"Very good app. Allows you to see your recent contacts with other ppl and even shows their status, whether they are at high, low risk,etc. It is a really helpful app."

Aravelly Sheshu,"December 1, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,3,"Worst maintanance, No record is maintained if one tested and confirmed as covid positive with using same mobile in both for testing and login with same mobile number.

Don't use this app. It will be different from one phone to another phone even though we placed it side by side at a time.

Jasveer World,"September 30, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,7,"Hey! Aarogya setu team I have ab idea for a feature that you can add to this app. As recently we see that a 19 year old girl was rapped and no action is taken against that. So, you can add an alert button to your app that a girl can use when she feels unsafe. When the girl click that button an alert message will be send to the other user of this app which are in range of 1Km that ""this user is unsafe"" and also the live location of the girl"
digi4 t3ch,"December 12, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,Aarogya setu app is a 100 % fake app. Because it's never shown an correct active covid-19 case.

Solve bugs asap.
Mangesh Gupta,"November 20, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,0,Good app for Covid notification but the area or radius options should be static as well as dynamic. So that we can check only those information which we desire to check...

UrB,"October 1, 2020",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,225,Everything's fine. A good try by the government. The problems are :- 1. It doesn't show accurately the no. Of covid patients around me. 2. It doesn't show the indicative status of people I came in close contact to. The gov. must tie up with social media and promote this app even more. They must advertise everywhere and make it compulsory to have this app downloaded just Like Facebook or Google before someone buys a new phone. It must also be mandatory to upload everyone's status to gov. servers
Satyapal Singh,"November 2, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,16,It's not as useful as we were anticipating because government promised that it could have a real time data but getting no Red flag.

So, you can add an alert button to your app that a girl can use when she feels unsafe, when the girl click that button an alert message will be send to the other users off this app which are in range of 1 km that ""this user is unsafe"" and also the live location of that girl.

Anmol Tikoo,"October 20, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,0,App can't detect whether you came in contact with COVID patient or not..rating as per my personal experience.

Shrikant Sarode,"December 6, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,Worst app. Only by using Bluetooth how we can identify that person is covid positive or not. Other information is good in this app like covid centre and all.

AMIT SHARMA,"December 4, 2020",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,0,I know if nothing is reliable than you have to keep your belief on something this app is little bit just like the same.

Shankha Majumder,"December 6, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,Have to keep Bluetooth on at all times which drains the battery a lot. Analysis done in the app is also not very accurate.
Prateek Jain,"September 26, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,24,"Stupid App. It keeps showing that you are safe, even if you come in contact with a Covid patient. I beacme Covid positive and uploaded my data to the government servers as it asks in case you are found positive. I isolated myself in a room. My father is also using this app but it always shows his status as safe even though we are in the same house and were sitting together the whole day before I was found positive. It never even warned him that a recent contact is found positive."

Anju Mishra,"October 13, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,379,This application is excellent. I shall urge every Indian citizen to download this application as it can really save lives. I have a few recommendations- 1) The application should alert you with frequent messages or a siren (through the phone's speaker) when a COVID-19 patient is nearby. 2) The application should be modified so that it consumes less battery. Keeping the bluetooth and location on all the time drains the phone's battery at great pace. Hoping for some improvement. Jai Hind 🇮🇳
Atul Kumar Gupta,"November 26, 2020",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,0,This is a very useful app when you where far from your home but the only negative point about this app to open the Bluetooth every time.
Mibon Teng,"September 26, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,"Really useless... What is the meaning of this app if it does not show the total no. Of infected person nearby me and its location. And why it's compulsory to have this app for flight boarding, metro station and also for college & other institutions."
Santosh Holla,"October 13, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,It could be made much better as the app will tell you after 3 or 5 days that you had come in contact with a person who is affected. Instead of alarming the user in the first place when he is near person who is affected.
Sunil Kumar,"October 9, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,0,I had a bit of problem earlier because the app didn't changed my status after I had recovered but now it has changed my status..Still it doesn't show me that I am herd immune which could have been better hoping for same in next update..😊

I don't get what this app is doing.

Sahil Saini,"October 3, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,96,It should have more features.It have the option of voice testing of the patient to detect symptoms by his/her voice and has the social distancing feature which alarms when person to person distance is <6 feet with the help of bluetooth and wi fi.If any person have the corona symptoms it should connect with hospital and police to isolate that person from spreading the virus to others.

Harsh wardhan,"October 14, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,Edit 1: if I have to restart my phone everytime I update then the usability of the app is zero. Devs need to fix it. Prev-review: Like everytime I open the app it asks me to re-register myself. I now even doubt if the info shown on the app is actually latest or not.
Prabhu Sahu,"November 17, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,28,This app is very good you can see the covid updates daily and the thing that I mostly like is that it shows the cvoid updates of all the states.

Jeremy Bosch,"November 24, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,Zero tracking information and absolutely terrible notification system. There is no use of this app with/without bluetooth and with/without GPS.

Saish Nevgi,"October 2, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,2,Not sure if app works correctly. But logsout the user randomly at anytime. App asks user to login back if you open it after few days. When the user logsout bluetooth contact tracing no longer works making the app useless. User is not even aware about it.
Pravin's Cuisine,"September 12, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,5130,"Totally useless app. If it has real time data on positive patients and their location, with my Bluetooth always on I expect that it warns me when I am in the vicinity. It does not. Moreover, now that I have 2 next door, it has no clue, it does not show them. It caused undue stress on me telling me I am at risk, two days after I may have crossed someone in a busy intersection. It is simply, ineffective, useless. I am not removing it only because some places want to check it."
ishan wankhade,"November 19, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,Pathetic app by the government. If the person don't have mobile and if he gives mobile number of other family member while testing. It shows positive on that person's mobile. illogical and irrelevant. the person suffers due his positive status though he is not positive and just by sharing his contact on behalf of his family member.

Anuman Consultant,"November 13, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,11,Honestly don't know how much this app is reliable and trust worth! Unless one gets registered with govt you will never know If anyone is infacted around! Which will be too late by the time one get notifications. It also needs to show the infacted / high / moderate person's number or if the person is on our contact list. That's will help us to keep more distance. It should also immediately prompt on the cell as pop up rather than we come to knowonly when we check the cell.
Akash Deshmane,"October 9, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,"Seems to be useless app, data uploading as per their comfort, sometimes they upload in early morning, sometimes afternoon or evening time. Graph Color visualisation very very very poor and worst quality."

John Zandbergen,"July 20, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,1969,"Good and important app, but the important information is difficult to find. Would be good if the size of the most important section 'in your area now' was increased so users do not have to wait until the information scrolls by. Also, it would be good if media-files were tagged with language. From the title it is not clear which ones are in Hindi and which are in English or other languages. Almost all movies are in Hindi, ignoring those (Tamil Nadu) who don't speak it. The back-button on my phone closes the app instead of going back to the previous screen. Hope you can do something with this feedback (for version 1.4.1)"

I stayed put at home and came back to "" You are safe"" status. Great App! Of late, since August 2020, the App messages especially in contacts duration category is erratic. For a specific date contact, if the duration is shown as 1 minute on that day, it is shown as 81 minutes for the same day after 2 or 3 days. Surprising! Needs attention!"

Bhupendra Sahu,"November 19, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,1,"It's not good but not bad as well. Developer should update required important things i.e. notification when you have passed any Covid-19 systomns or patient, health report of your local area or no of cases can be updated in this app so that the person who is using this can take more precautions as per received details through this app."
Avinash Avikam,"October 10, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,"This app is just garbage and of Seriously no use. Govt making it compulsory for airline travel and hospital visit but it's totally useless app. I'm a covid +ve patient and in hospital for around 10 days.

Anuj Dubey,"November 18, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,1,Totally useless app. It's just a formality or can say Compulsion to download it. Govt. Cell should think something innovatively so as to improve the function of this App for what it's really intended.
Raky Sharma,"November 24, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,I have been treated and recovered from COVID but the App still indicates me Positive. There is no way to set Status to Recovered. This has become a liability and stigmatic. And you get a standard reply to send full details of your device. Cant the developer ensure complatibility for all devices and Android versions?
Parisa Visal,"November 6, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,0,This app did not accept my number when required. I was at the passport office and there it is compulsory to show this app .... Because of this app it took mi extra 2 hours . Didn't like this application at all. Very sad .

NIRUPA P,"October 1, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,3,Totally useless app. Installation of this app was necessary even in those remote areas where there is no basic internet facility especially for government servants.

Manaswi Manjappa Gundi,"December 10, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,The app says you're safe if you say you have no symptoms. It requires you to have your Bluetooth turned on at all times. Absurd. Privacy risk for sure

Arputharaj Johnson,"October 16, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,1,Read my query before asking for technical details.

Darshan Prasad,"September 22, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,0,"This app needs an update, where it should give some live notification or alert if someone infected is nearby. It shows after 2 3 days that I got in touch with infected person...What's the point of knowning it that much late."
shweta kumari,"October 30, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,Wrong information. I don't go out at all. Still it shows that I came in contact with few people. Whereas my husband goes out and data shows only 1 or 2 people he interacted with. Both phones have Bluetooth on always. Useless app
Shyamal Kumar Bhattacharya,"November 20, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,It is good for nothing. For last 7 months it is showing same thing Covid19 patient is within 1km near me but the fact is Covid19 patient was even 100meter near to me at one time. So this app is bogus.
Anil Khera,"October 20, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,1,"Does Aarogya Setu App gives you the right result ? Using Blue tooth it captures the data. Assume you are walking and will pass thru homes/ people all at 6 ft plus distance but it will capture the data and if any one becomes Covid positive , App will say you have come in contact with Covid infected person and status will become Red. And many such cases like delivery boy delivers outside the home or you are standing in balcony . Showing incorrect information in logs."
GANESH LAKADE,"December 2, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,"Its of no use unless and untill postive patient uses it with correct information. One positive patient is living in my next building (at less than 100 m away), but Aarogya Setu didnt show any nearby postive patient."

Somil Mishra,"August 1, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,1177,"Requires you to keep bluetooth on at all times, very limited in scope. It's a nice gesture, but I feel that's just what it is. A placebo. If it helps you sleep better, it's nice. I hate that organisations impose this invasive app on people though. I think they can add journalling perhaps, make it less reliable on data input by the users and more able to rate users on the basis of the likelihood they may have the virus. It can never be infalliable, but it will be more useful than askingclear q.s"
Anjali Pandey,"September 20, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,0,"From last 4-5 days it's not working, today I uninstalled it den again installed its showing my mobile no. Invalid. Otherwise it's a helpful app bcoz it notified me when I came in contact wid the positive one."
Anirban Biswas,"July 16, 2020",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,1658,"I have a suggestion regarding adding a point. At the time of giving input there should be a option "" I am a part of essential service provider(like Banking service)."" Being a nationalised banker I need to interact with various people even during this lock down period. It is impossible for me/us to keep track of every person, that we interact is covid positive or not. That is why I think the option of ""Essential service provider"" should be added along with ""health worker"" to make it more useful."
MATHEMATICAL LOCHA,"September 21, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,1,Excellent app. But all we know any thing is better it dose not mean it cannot improve.

Deepak Deshpande,"October 25, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,1,It is a very useful app in the current situation of Pandemic. Only problem with the app is that the lines in the graph of Daily Covid Updates are totally invisible. The lines are vidible in Cumulative updates.
R. B. Karhade,"October 16, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,Good app for tracking covid19 infected person nearby. It helps really.. Updating on 16.10.2020 found bug. Not tracking of covid patients in close contact. Now it's just a app which only consumed memory.

avishek prakash,"November 13, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,9,"This app is mere formality because: 1. No live tracking or warning of covid patients/high risk people nearby. 2. 7-10days delay in updating risk status post contact with covid positive person. 3. App dosnet work on iPhones, I am covid positive and my next seat office colleague is still Green. This has happened at least 5-10times. Inspite of being a software power house we Indians can't come up with a proper app for contact tracing and warning or may be no one wants a properly functioning app."

It asks for various symptoms when there are many asymptomatic cases around. So, how the app can say whether infected with corona or not, when there are no symptoms. In this technology driven era, people expect continuos improvisation of the app."
Jagat Singh Sajwan,"November 18, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,0,"Is data shown in the App reliable? We (myself, my wife & PH son) are using App but there is wide variation in data shown in individuals App whereas we all three used to go out (if any day) on walk on footpath of main road folling all the pre cautions together as PH son require support for walk.

Dipesh Patidar,"July 20, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,574,"The most important piece of information one expect from this app is how many covid positive persons are there in locality (500m,1km etc) and the display of that information is not consistent at all. Sometimes it is shown automatically on the home screen of app and some time it is nowhere. Also, to make it worse, there's no option to see that info in the app. So if it not shown you just can't do anything."
Tim Rutter,"October 13, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,It won't allow me to enter my phone location just keeps saying an error logging me in and no otp arrives. If you want to help pe6you should make sure your app works easily. Otherwise its useless
Praveen Kullu,"October 3, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,3,Totally useless app. It gives results based only on self assessment test and not by antigen/rt pcr test. Which can be faked by anyone. You say you have cough fever and it will show you at high risk or corona positive. It should show rt pcr and antigen test results based on mobile number.😷

Rahul Maniyaria,"November 1, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,3,Alert notification not work. Annoying always on app running notification. If COVID vaccine was not created in Mid of year 2020 then how covid patients got healthy and if they very only symptomatic then why they were not removed from these stats after they declared well.
deepankar jana,"October 7, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,"This is a rubbish and uncooked app. We have to put our medical condition ourselves then it will tell everyone how we are feeling. And if there's covid patients around. It cannot detect anything on itself which is impossible. Just like all govt projects, half baked and half researched."
Sarath Premkumar,"July 15, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,847,"Lot of loopholes. Firstly, it completely depends on answers the user give. It can be wrong. Secondly, if you don't travel with your phone or travel with bluetooth off, the app does nothing. There should be an option to manually enter past locations. For instance, I was in a hospital for 4 days last week and since my bluetooth & location were off, app doesn't recongnise any possible contacts. If I could manually enter the hospital location and dates it would be much more dependable."
Neeraj Sarma Bhrdwaj,"November 27, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,Useless Helpline No. Useless information. Useless App. I don't understand why people giving it 4.3 rating. Same review.. even after two months of first review.

Josetuttu Vazhaparambil,"September 3, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,674,"Bluetooth bug. The app is always prompting me to turn on Bluetooth even though it's already turned on. The only way to avoid this annoying popup is to turn off Bluetooth, open setu app again, click on turn on Bluetooth in the popup. Fix this as it is very annoying. Also, why don't you show all three count statistics readily on the screen. Why do you want user to wait for each text to appear. I am interested in viewing no of people infected near me and I need to wait some time for it to appear."

Rajat Choudhary,"November 15, 2020",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,1,This app is very good to track near by covid-19 patients but some time this app does not properly show or resposne late when any covid patient cross your path. Some more things need to be improved.
Kamal Paradigm,"August 12, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,560,"I feel you can further improvise the app. You give contact details for last 28 days but the data doesn't change even if you increase the contacts. As I am going to office, I get in contact with many persons but still I see same data. Also what is the use of 28 days data when actually last 5 days are important. Secondly you should change the questions you ask as they are not relevant in today's context. We want this app to be reliable and much used."

Ishu Priye Madhok,"August 16, 2020",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,966,"This is a very good app as it gives you a fair idea of the covid-19 situation in your neighbourhood.

Do they signify distance? If yes, how much distance? I searched the FAQ section but could not find any answers."
P K,"July 9, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,766,"It's life saving app. However I feel that it has impacted performance of mobile a bit. May be because it is always on and accessing Bluetooth, location and internet simultaneously. 9/Jul/20: The above issue has been resolved. However, this version is not trustworthy.

No support to rectify this error."
Anil Kumar,"July 26, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,234,"Earlier it was not so accurate but with the passage of time it is improving. If the app is able to trace contacts having double sim in their phone, it would be more useful and dependable. One of my contacts is presently covid +ve but since he has share some different number with app server than his number in my contact list, so he is not featuring in my app as high risk or positive contact.

Vaibhav Sharma,"July 12, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,1022,"The most important part of this app I think is that how many people are affected within 500m to 5km area. But the information which comes as a list one by one, is not scrollable and I think it is not that user friendly. Instead there should be a seperate tab (like Media tab, Covid updated tab) where for every 500m, 1km, 3km and so on ranges, we get all the info in one go and not wait for each line of info to come one by one."
Jagatjit Barik,"August 3, 2020",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,289,"The app needs to be updated as it shows the 3-4 days old data (contact with infected persons). For eg, today is 3rd Aug but the lat sync time shows 30th Jul. I suggest the sync should be upto date every time. Apart from this, I like the app very much. Thank you for such a great effort to keep us updated about the status of our health. Looking forward to get it improved with the solutions for the problems mentioned. Thanks."

I even waited for sometime, but nothing there. The purpose of app is also to have details of knowing positive cases arround the area and hence if this useful feature is not available, the half purpose of app is lost. Please fix the bug."
Dibyendu Karmakar,"July 4, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,598,It would be much more accurate if the app itself force the user to self assess themselves in a periodic interval; say in every 3 to 4 days or in a week. In that way we wont need to wait for the results that the user to self assess themselves. Another feature that can be added is to send a notification to the user if they come in close proximity of any high risk user or an infected person so that the user dont need to open the app to see if he/she has come under close proximity of any such person
Dipayan Sarkar,"July 7, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,616,It is nice to see that the App is working to its potential. Please add a feature that will automatically know if a person has booked train/airplane tickets and their journey and show it in the App. Since Unlock02 has started it will be again bustling with people so if the App could show where the concentration of people are nearby me so that I can just avoid the place. And some information regarded to nearest COVID isolation center would also be useful. These are my suggestions. 👍🏽
Mihaela Iancu,"November 12, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,Stopped working properly. It's not showing anymore the contacts around me. For more than one month I have the same old contacts even if I am going in crowded supermarkets.
Manoj Goel,"July 12, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,543,It's a great and innovative initiative by Govt. Of India. Much appreciated. There are few more features required like app should beep when you are in vicinity of a infected person or a person with high risk. This will help people to be alert and protect nearby people much earlier before they get infected. Current by the time app updates status it is already too late and the person has already got infected. Hope you will do the needful. Rest all is just great. 👍
Muni Krishna,"October 6, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,"A very worst app. Just 1 star can't worth to this app . But I has to give to write a review . It's showing your safe , But within 100 metre of my location nearly 5-6 covid cases had been reported so far"

Vinod Kumar,"July 11, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,363,"Nice app but it is experienced by me that most of time after updating, the app again ask for registration. It happened to me 3 times since using this app i.e. from April, 2020 onward. I am using this app on my two mobile numbers but on Samsung Galaxy S20+ its reinstalled 3 times after updating. In the last update all the data has been erased and it is showing only 3 contacts who were traced in Bluetooth proximity. On the other hand in my another mobile i.e. Mi A3 the total persons showing at 136 [I have installed this app in both mobile phones on the same day]. I think there is a lag which required to be resolved. 2. Tracing of nearby Covid-19 cases by the app is really wonderful and totally accurate and the developers team had done good job which really appreciable."
Smrohan Vaidya,"July 10, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,375,"Ok app. Continuous bluetooth and location consumes too much battery. Could there be any alternative to this? If the app can list down the containment zones and advice users to stay out of that if by chance user is visiting the place, that could be a great feature. If map could be displayed instead of plain text, this could be very informative."
Sandeep Mishra,"July 4, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,485,App is awesome. I would like to have one very important feature though. Currently app shows recent contacts with their status. It would be really helpful if we can show the location where user contacted with High risk patients. This will help us to find out the high risks places and ultimately can help us to stay safe by avoiding such places. Not sure about the feasibility of this feature.

Santoshpriya Gupta,"July 28, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,437,"Using it as advised by Hon'l PM, but non too happy. I am synchronising data every day, but there is a randomness in getting the info on proximity, location, duration and time details of Infected & high severity contacts. This info could be very much helpful in avoiding certain people, routes and altering timing of the movements. The info, if at all appears, it's days later, making recollection of the events near impossible. The effectiveness & efficiency of this App needs to be evaluated often."
Subrat Prajapati,"October 17, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,2,"Possibility after million of user enrolled, now this app is waste for having on phone when needed most. 90% time it shows error 404, refresh etc. If we feel app is useless for covid prevention, remove it from playstore. This kind of things really gives a bad picture of Gov.initiated programmes using a tool,corruption at plaster stage whereas accountable Head is only to be caught but earliest. Better use Google and give some time to find resources."
Raktim Das,"September 4, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,151,"Very helpful service and a neat interface. However, I have the following observations: 1) The graph of daily Active Cases is mathematically wrong - it's not correctly plotting the negative values. The days when there is a reduction in active cases in a state or in India the bar shows a 0 value while it should be negative. The y axis should start from minus values instead of zero. 2) The Deceased and Recovered graphs are hazy and unclear as the bar colour is too light in contrast to background."
Md S,"October 9, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,1,"The App shows I came in contact with infected person on 7th and 8th October at around 8.30 pm. However, at that time in both days I was at home and there is no covid patient in my building. No one came to my home at that time also. Therefore there is no chance of me coming in contact with anyone infected orotherwise. Stil it is warning me. I can't understand how this app shows such scary results. This will only create scare for the person using it. I don't know how this app results."

It will be best to provide proximity details of the positive person like date and time if possible locations. 2. Also to make self test on the app regularly by pushing notification or creating a reminder. 3. Also to show in contacts who are using this app, so it will be best to avoid peoplel who are not using it. 4. Also add integrate an oximeter app/ system within this app. Or input from other devices. 5.Add Family member system to track wheather they are vulnerable."

So that, 1) After the covid19 test, report should automatically get updated in system. It will reduce unnecessary exposure to covid center while collecting result. 2) No need to enter data manually or risk of false medical information by individual. 3) it will be a totally transparent. 4) by linking it to a Aadhar, govt will have a real time record of all covid related data."

arul selvan,"October 20, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,4,first of all when a covid patient gets admitted to hospital this app must be registered for his number or aadhar by self or family members or by national covid monitoring team. Such that all real time covid cases are recorded. Secondly it must show close to real time. Say 2 hours old data could be acceptable but not 10 to 15 days old data. Ideally this app is not doing good for me. There seems to be no vision around this app to help citizens. Just for national purpose how many will volunteer for your data collection. Frequently signing out so I hate to re-login again and again. It must use aadhar to create family tree automatically.

Deepak Chitnis,"August 8, 2020",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,200,"Good experience. But one suggestion, along with recent contacts the app should show proximity and time period for which the person was in that proximity. For example, if one is close to 3 contacts, the app should show 1 high risk contact at 6 feet for 10 mins 1 moderate risk contact at 8 feet for 5 mins 1 low risk contact at at 4 feet for 20 mins This will help further drill down the overall risk level.

This will allow to capture almost all mobiles. You must be maintaining records of all tested positive with mobile no. This will help identify more accurate results. Also send push notification to all smart phone users to install it mandatorily(telcos have this info). You may also insist that this app should run even if data pack is exhausted.

Plus you can provide option to check based on within 24 hours, 2days, 1 week, 2 weeks or more than 2 weeks. After more than 2 weeks does not make much sense or can collaborate them together."

It was still asking if you have travelled internationally when the international flights were stopped."
Pankaj Tripathi,"July 8, 2020",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,356,It's working good.

G K Pande,"August 26, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,29,Absolutely useless app. Does not give status of contacts for days together even after frequently uploading data to the site. Worst do not even reply e-mail for days. What use is the app if you don't even know that you have contacted covid positive for days together and one sweet morning the app gives a data that you had contacted a positive few days back. The app claims data update in three hours if the claim is not achievable the least could be that the data is updated at least once in 24 hrs.

rajesh chavan,"October 6, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,11,This really anoying as I don't have any symptoms even I have not undergone with any test for covid still app is showing my status as covid 19 positive. Due to someone who had done a mistake and mapped my mobile number with the covid 19 patient. Me and my family suffering with so many stress due to this I have undergone with covid test and found negative. Which reports I have already shared still I am showing as a covid 19 positive status. I am realy unhappy with this app.
Kapil Kumar,"November 21, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,Worst app.Not showing list of ICMR approved labs and covid centres. Tried multiple times to check the list. But it's not showing anything
Gita Velu,"July 9, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,1058,"Very useful App with improved features of contact tracing. Few suggestions., 1. Can we know the contact nos of ""High Risk of Infection"". This will help to stay away from them or quarantining. 2. Can we get an auto upload system rather than manual upload of data. The recent update in version 1.4.1 to add additional numbers to know their status is really fantastic. Very useful update."
Hemant Jain,"July 14, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,12,Work by the government in managing the all is good. It has a problem with seeing the nearby cases.

Honest Review,"September 1, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,114,"Hi, I hv been using this app past many months & lot of updates have been done. That's great. But I have a suggestion- This app is being checked at the entrance of all units, factories & offices , How wil this app. ensure that the person displaying ""you are Safe"" do not display an old screen shot? I would suggest, if the current date & time can be displayed on the right corner of ""You are Safe"" (green band/red band...) tab, it will eliminate the chances of people displaying an old screenshot ."
Abhishek Pathak,"September 3, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,199,"Useless App. While answering self assessment test question ""have you recently contacted a covid 19 patient"" there should be a ""not sure"" option. People are not transparent in telling whether they had Corona or not. Also the app should tell exactly with whom we came in contact. Another flaw is that when sometime back my neighbour from just across the street came positive the app for 10+ days kept showing no covid 19 patient in your area."
Praveen Singh,"September 14, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,231,Not even single feature works. The app have some bug in the bluetooth but always promt it to turn on. The recent contacts are less than 200 whereas people around me have more than 2k recent contacts. Bluetooth works in other apps so there is no fault in it. Totally bakwas app. I have already emaild the support team on 10th September 2020 but there is no response even after reminder emails.

Laxmi Naidu,"July 27, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,6,"This app is brilliant. But, i have a problem with this app. The problem is that whenever i open the app,the app is alerting me that near you some corona positive peoples are there.after that so many time i called to police officers to investigate all the positive peoples.but no people is getting positive because they are giving wrong information in arogya setu app by self testing. For that what we have to do. But i really appreciate our indian government for making this helpfull app.🇮🇳🇮🇮🇳"

Prakshalraj Tated,"October 14, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,1,BUG: Selecting 500m radius just hides the 'in your area' panel and brings up the trending panel. Selecting other values of radius works fine.

Avinash Khairnar,"July 16, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,328,"This is a very good app. However, I feel it should expand its horizon to improve overall health of users.

As we cannot control this. additional features required on urgent basis like taking support of service provider bases on signal. Also with GPS. However this app is useful to govt. to get inputs from us and to take necessary precautions. This should disclose by govt.
Soumen Kumar Dey,"July 18, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,276,"I don't find it useful. In recent contacts, it list number of recent contacts with moderate risk or low risk. Instead it should raise some alarm when we come near some moderate risk people so that we can take more precautions. Also requesting people with moderate risk that you don't go out as it can spread to more person."

Shweta Singh,"August 22, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,239,"This is a wonderful app. And I am sure crores of people are benefitting from this. My concern is regarding the status change from Red to Green color, after one has recovered from covid. There is no option for the recovered person to update it. The local authorities say they have updated, but still the status is showing as red, 12 days after testing negative for covid. There needs to be better meachanisn for this updation. This is causing lot of issues"

kri dahiya,"July 11, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,43,"It's was a nice application but it has started giving wrong assessment results off lately (when all the answers to ur questions are NO). How can someone with absolutely No symptoms, be highly infected? Plus, there is no call from ur side. When govt. can access this status & they feel that the user is highly infected (because app states that) , you don't even call and check upon the actual status. You should fix such issues on your app, as by fake results you are making people panic."
Kaushik Gadani,"August 14, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,131,"Getting 403 error since a day, after cleaning cache and reinstalling app, app is not recognising my mobile number in registration.

Ravindra Shah,"July 8, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,46,"Myself and my wife have downloaded the app and have been together since the lockdown started. We go out together every time but the app shows different figures w.r.t. the cases and tests etc within 500m, 1km, etc. Moreover the recent upgrade shows number of people in contact and here too the figures in the app on our mobiles shows drastically different figures. How's that possible? The vast difference in all the figures that that app shows raises doubts about the authenticity of the data."
ISHITA SINGH,"August 6, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,149,For some reason this app gives me a message that the web page could not be loaded and I am not able to get any details. I have the latest updated app on my phone so no issues because of an older version. I an uninstalling it and going to reinstall the app in a few minutes. Will update the results of reinstallation here in the review if the app works for me after reinstallation.
Yash Sharma,"August 15, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,20,"Overall okay app, but it should give some kind of alert if we are near infected/ high risk or moderate risk person. Later on knowing that you that you were near infected person is of no use. Moreover it should tell that which of our contacts are infected/high risk or moderate risk persons, so that care should be taken while interacting with them."

Yajnesh Jathan,"August 16, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,33,"It was good until I realised that the app doesn't notify me if I came in contact with an infected person through bluetooth proximity. Every time I have to tap the ""see recent contact"". App should notify me immediately so that I can be more careful if there is any infected person nearby me. Please do the needful"
Vishwa Mohan Saxena,"July 22, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,12,"Synced my contacts with server. It shows that one contact is at high risk. Since app knows the person name than it should show the name instead of giving ""person is at high risk"". Or atleast give the area or where contact got infected. Everything based on bluetooth proximity so app knows the location also. It would help to keep protected from infected person."
Gauri Nair,"July 5, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,8,Could you please tell us on how the new update works? It shows all the contacts made in a circle with dots along with the health status. Are these only nearby contacts or contacts made while travelling since I see the place of dots keep changing. Please give us a detailed explanation on how the latest update works as its very important to know about it right now. I see no one is clearly aware of it and it is not even written anywhere in the app of the latest update.

Even if I don't know who is the person from whom I have a risk then how I safe from that situation in real time. If only number of downloads and information gathering about an individual is the moto of this app then it will get 5 star, otherwise it should be zero."
Raj Saptal,"July 28, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,14,I have a concern with this app.. if a person is tested positive the app status gets updated immediately... But unfortunately when the same person completes his treatment and does the second test and when the results are negative then the status is not updated.. why is this delay in updating the current and the correct status. I have also written on the email id that was provided with all the required details. But unfortunately still there is no update from your end.
burning desire,"July 7, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,35,"This app is good but needs some improvement like , report just after or immediately we came in contact with infected person with exact or nearest distance with them , 2).if they provide something alarm like things immediately after we get into contact with some one so that we can be aware our selfs at that moment and not so late as there is no advantage of this app so late."
subramanian n aiyer,"July 25, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,179,I have sent queries to the support team more than 30 days back. No response and not even an acknowledgement. This is an half baked app with people behind scenes not bothered about any improvement to this. For me it shows I came into contact with a person who was covid infected at a particular point of time and I was at the airport that time. How the airport authorities permitted such person to travel. Government just does any job mechanically without bothering for follow ups.
KN Reddy,"July 23, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,1,"Great initiative, it is intended to show isaues upto 10km.

GADELAVARTHI SARATH,"September 4, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,34,"I'm using this app since it is launched but only shows 2 contacts that's it. I have travelled and even go out daily but still it is showing only 2 contacts. Already done resetting network, uninstalled and reinstalled, cleared data nothing works. Actually I think it is a waste of space by installing this app since it won't work. Better to uninstall rather than just consuming my data."
Yamini Jain,"October 9, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,Not useful.. doesn't show any alter or any message when you are near COVID patient. Government should feed data of currently positive patients. Very useless app.
Yogesh Dalavi,"July 16, 2020",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,18,First thing that come to my mind about that section which shows information about how many covid+ve people found in area specifically in the vicinity of 2/5/10 km should be large and not need to scroll. This is the main information the app is intended for..so make it larger and all other things are great as indian gov doing..thanks...
Pranay Sawant,"October 1, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,3,At checking status it says upload your data if you want to see other unknown data and in menu there's a warning message that only share your data if you are covid positive. I am safe until now but due to this stupid double meaning sentence I would have registered myself as COVID positive. Non sense
Pankaj Upadhyay,"September 3, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,168,There seems to be some issue. It's reporting isn't accurate since the time mentioned with contacts is wrong. I was alone in my car during that specific duration. Need to sort the tracing sooner to give accurate information. Else it will leave tension sigma on users. UPDATED: The development team takes notice and ask for suggestions which is a good sign. Only suggestion is to take identity among traffic scenario in account
Harpreet Bhatti,"July 27, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,11,"The app jumps to conclusions, has no relevance, is not updated properly either so at any given moment it can show any random conclusion For example in qurantine it showed low risk for me (i was quatantined next to the airport) and after being tested and being negative, the risk jumped to moderate simply because in their retarded survey i have replied thay i have hypertension (mild) and this hypertension has existed for a year or two and is mostly the result of a sedentary lifesty"
Dino Mon,"July 6, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,10,"The main disadvantage of the app is bluetooth must be switched on, it drains out the battery and most of the users will not be doing it.

This will definitely increase the number of users and make them open the app daily to know about their own risk. If there are constraints in disclosing the name then date, time and place must be informed for the benefit of all.

Sharvani Srinath,"July 22, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,29,The app is doing very good. But I also think it lacks some sort of motivation.

Kulbhushan Sharma,"August 7, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,5,Good app but it creates panic when you don't even meet or interact with an infected person and he just passes by thereby registering Bluetooth proximity for less than a minute or so...

Ankur Kumar,"September 17, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,10,"Completely useless and a battery drainer. It should at least show nearby test centres. Update: Since they have responded quickly, keeping location on all the times consumes power too. And given that it's an app backed by the government it should show the nearby testing centres.

Raj Mondal,"July 19, 2020",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,2,"Till now it is good.

With the most recent update, no longer showing it even after reinstalling. It shows loading window and vanishes. Please fix the problem."
Amar Patil,"July 16, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,9,"This app is quite useless.When a person self assesses the it directly give the message of MILD SYMPTOMS when the person is in perfect condition. Also there is discrepancy in the data which is shown.The infected people should be shown on the google maps. This is for App for the idiots, for the idiots and by the idiots. DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS APP. Remove the junk ads PMcare Fund, Trending things. INDIA CANNOT CONTROL PANDEMIC OF CORONAVIRUS."
Hardik Rathod,"July 1, 2020",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,386,"As this apo has been mandatoy now, in organisations HR & Security do check the status of the app on daily basis. People used to self check daily but there is no indiaction of date of self check, the date should be visible to know that when a particular person has self checked, i think most of people does not do self check daily. Showing of date will be more helpful."
Subramaniam Shanmugavelu,"October 12, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,0,Not dependable. Gives random number for the past 28 days reported cases. Retains same results when you move to New location.
Atul Vats,"July 14, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,37,Excellent app. One of my colleague was diagnosed covid + but he did not disclose. Because of Aayogya setu my status turned orange & I was able to trace him with my recent interactions. Suggestion Interlocking of logging in with same mobile number (inside phone) should be done so that no one can misuse it. ( similar to Aadhar app).
Shiva Kumar,"July 16, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,1,It's not at all use full there more than 8 cases near me with in 300m radius still it's showing nothing. Waste of time using this.

Please update this asap.

But for your kind information from last 12 - 15 days I have not gone out of my house and even my family members were not gone out of the house. So I don't know how it's showing that I came in contact of the infected person.. Please update......"

Chaitanya Tarra,"July 6, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,428,"Useless app. When an app is developed to have fast communication, it should have proper access for every user to reach helpline. It says 'Please check the number you dialed' when u click on call helpline. If we just need to look at those pictures, we don't need an app for it, can look in Google too."
Vins,"September 9, 2020",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,113,"Couple of suggestions- 1. Add link to FAQs to menu option, currently only available at lower end of home screen 2. As status reliability is dependent on duration while Bluetooth / GPS was ON. So add thin but visible progress bars (2 - 1 for each connectivity option) across the width of home screen or gradient shading of status area. Do consider duration to use for representation as most will keep then ON only during active time of day (i.e. switch off at night or once back home)"
Atul Mehla,"September 8, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,153,can't get past the otp screen. It seems like their otp verification is not working as I have tried two different devices with two different numbers. Tried multiple time but no luck. Please fix. Update: changed rating from 2 to 1. Reason: considering how all these government apps are developed and how the otp system requires you to be in india with an Indian number for the otp system to work is a poor way of authentication. If there was an option to give 0 stars I definitely would.
Sangram Chaudhuri,"July 13, 2020",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,12,"'See recent contacts' is the most important feature of this app. But it's still not so useful. Please try to make a live map based service where every Aarogya Setu user can see the density of COVID-19 affected people or unhealthy people in real-time, so that, they can avoid to go that particular red zone. On the other hand, 'self-assesment' is a useless feature, nobody wants to tell their actual health condition due to some unknown fear. And lastly, make this app available for smartwatches."
Sanjeet A,"August 25, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,10,"App is able to display me the no of covid diagnosed people in my vicinity but the recent contact is certainly not working. I keep my bluetooth and location on for all the time. Also the app has very poor navigation. If I am watching a video, pressing back button exits the app. And this navigation issue exists throughout the app."

subhajit dutta,"August 12, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,12,The updated version of the app shows if I have been in contact with an infected person that's great. But the thing is today it is showing that I have been in a contact with a infected person at 13:09 but the time shown in there is not correct as I was driving I can say this because I received a call at 13:06. Than how can I came in contact with some one at 13:09. Need to work on this otherwise all fine..
Ankur,"September 19, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,1,This app save my life. When I check this app for checking it is showing you are at risk I thought it has some problem but tomorrow some medical official came and paste home quarantine poster on next floor of my house (less tha 30 meter distance from my house) Thankyou modi ji.
CA. KIRANKUMAR R N,"July 7, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,829,"Hi, I have been using this app since it launched. However since one week my status showing ""unable to evaluate your risk"". Please advise how to fix issue. Another suggestion from my end. Can you please indicate in this app the street or cross roads identification of positive cases so that we can avoid such main or cross roads. For instance there are 5 positive cases within 500 ms in my case but we are clueless which main or cross roads exactly so that we can avoid those Streets."
Anupama Gupta,"August 7, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,37,"It can be improvised by including the feature of temp check in the app using infrared model. Also, it can be sync/connected with the equipment measuring vitals like BP & PR of the patient(as is done in govt set ups in Japan for the purpose of health surveillance). Overall the app is fine & working fairly good for the purpose it's meant.Great work."
Niketa Singh,"July 5, 2020",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,452,"App is evolving and there is lot of scope of improvement. With latest update, it shows how many users I got in contact who are at high risk. It should also show the contact number of those high risk people so that we can keep a check if they are found Covid positive and do we need to test if any minor symptoms are there."
MAHATMA KOVVADA,"August 26, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,16,Use less app even no star option will be there I will give that. When ever we are near to covid positive person or high risk person no alarm no alerts it's showing. After that if we search in the status it's showing one high risk . What is the use of this. Even it is not showing the date and time for which the high risk contact is near by me . so that we will take extra care when we visit the same place or area. Lot of modification has to be done otherwise it's useless app.
Partha P Majumdar,"September 28, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,Ridiculous app. Same questions being asked since Day 1. 45 days from foreign visit is long over. Kindly change parameters in view of community transmission.
Deepak B. Chand,"July 28, 2020",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,37,"This is good app. But it does not capture the correct data for individual.

Rishi raj Hada,"July 17, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,17,"Need to update the self assessment questionnaire.

I supported the app and downloaded it in the starting but now after various updates it stopped working. I am using Samsung Galaxy A30s . I also uninstalled the app and downloaded it again so If u could help it would be great, because i almost missed my last flight due to the app as it was not loging me in and i wasnt able to show the status to the official."
Sanyam Basran,"November 26, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,App is useless. Doesn't give appropriate data. This is the only app...where everyone has given 1 star and still it's rating is 4.1 out of 5 😂
Shripad Deshpande,"August 18, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,25,"Very nice initiative by the Govt and makers of this app. However, it shows different numbers positive around even if accessed from not densely populated area and persons in the same building. Yesterday it showed 1 person positive in 500m whereas today it shows 151 positive cases on my mobile. In someone else's mobile, it shows only 1 person positive around. Please look in to it and correct it. Thanks!"
YOGESH DESAI,"August 13, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,19,"Not a perfect app. Because at the same time and same place it is showing different results in 2 different mobiles. However both mobiles are used at same place. Also provide the Covid updates with district, taluka or village wise. You can give us such results by clicking the State. So that it will much useful."
Yash Bhatt,"November 6, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,"I was forcibly made to download this app, otherwise I cannot enter into any passport office, airports etc. Plus the government has no idea where my data is going! Why would I download something which violets my privacy."
Akshay Mahajan,"July 17, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,55,"It is good as a preventive measure but once you are infected but discharged after 17 days, it keeps showing You are COVID-19 positive unless you get tested negative. But the government has clearly laid out its guidelines stating that testing is not required after 17 days of Institutional/Home quarantine. So once you get infected, you can just stop using this app because it turns meaningless."
Ninad Gilankar,"July 29, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,36,"Worst app ever created. First it asks for the mobile number. After typing the mobile number, it says that,' there is some error logging in'. I really want to help the government by installing this app and reccomending it to others, but it just won't work. I tried typing the number a thousand times but it just wont work"
Sahil Yadav,"September 23, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,"Where does it show that you are safe or unsafe, there are few questions for which anyone can answer and it shows safe or high risk. Whereas a person is staying home from past 4 months and not even visited outside or touched any outside stuff. This app doesn't comply anything. Kindly make changes to make it effective."
neha negi,"October 26, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,0,"Under the recent contacts, the app shows status of 1 is high risk & 1 is moderate but i am unable to check the date & time of proximity.

Jeevan Karant,"July 28, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,13,"Don't rely on the app showing you are safe! It doesn't show real data. I had two people infected in 40 meters radius, they were admitted, my street sealed and still it was showing no cases found in surrounding. Does it need the patient to be at home even after testing positive for it to show if we are at risk? My family members have lost confidence on this had are thinking of removing it."
Shreya Nagar,"September 30, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,33,"If the soal purpose of this app to keep u safe then sorry it's not at all good app. It can't show me number of contacted person, the personal diagnosis part is also not apt, I have been in contact with covid positive in last one day, I updated the same in app but no one came to keep check on me, to do the testing part nothing at all. It always says I m safe. Can't rely on this app"
Indira M,"July 14, 2020",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,30,"Hi all, Initially the app was not working once I installed it. Then as advised by the Aarogya Setu Tech Support Team, Forum and Local shop person, I formatted my phone and Updated my Phone software, keeping ON the WiFi network along with Mobile Data network.

ABHISHEK KUMAR,"September 4, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,3,"There is No such Error issue, My simple queries is why 2 different reading when you uninstalled the Aarogya Setu and again install and then u check the radius data of 0.5 km or 1 km With you phone at same Static positioning within 1 min of difference in re-installing the App...my phone is already updated, my Phone is UnRooted.....i am already using Samsung Mobile...A5 model with Airtel provider(AHMEDABAD)....pls don't say i need A new mobile device to get the issue cleared up..."
Rupesh Kamboj,"July 5, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,28,"Aarogya Setu app provides wrong data. I am checking it on daily basis and they are updating anything as per their requirement. For eg, I checked it at same location from two different devices and data showing on different devices are different. How is this possible? Secondly I checked let's suppose today you are showing 10 Covid patients in 500mtr radius and 20 Covid patients in 1km. Tomorrow you are showing 8 Covid patients in 500mtr and 19 Covid patients in 1km. How is this possible?"
Epicurean Pratzie,"August 21, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,151,It has been a total of 4½months since I have downloaded this app till now I have not been able to even register through this app. I have to travel tomorrow and this app is still not working.

The key info of covid risk users/patients around us can be quickly presented by a 5x5 grid with 5 radi and 5 user category. It will teduce the manual work and data load due to different tabs and scroll messages. Also for the covid status graphics, please include testing numbers as some states have reduced testing to show lower counts. Testing numbers will give us more correct real picture. Thanks"
Sathish Palanisamy,"July 28, 2020",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,2,19,"The key stats are s rolling slowly. But unnecessary trending topics are appearing always. Please update the app to show the important data of how many cases are in .5km /1km/2km/5km/10km. Remove the scrolling behavior and show the cases reported always. Auto-Scrolling is annoying. It was great 15 years ago, but not in this world!!"
Ganu D,"July 21, 2020",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,0,I don't understand why the local area updates have to scroll on their own in a very narrow space. That makes users wait and concentrate unnecessarily. Otherwise the app works fine for the intended purpose.

Dilip Mantripragada,"July 17, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,24,"Decent app as long as it's accurate. One suggestion: In recent contacts scan, my data shows 3 Moderate risk contacts. But can you show details like when and where these 3 Moderate risk contacts I encountered? TIMESTAMP, Date stamp, Geolocation and proximity of these Moderate to High risk contacts should be easy to show as you are collecting that data instantly in real time. The current graphic, a human inside circles with dots is useless and does not provide any actionable information."

Aniket Kumar,"July 21, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,8,"I have one suggestion is that , please remove last 30 days process , you guys must put daily updates , like today in 500 m how much +ve case come , app always show last 30 days , how we can analyse situation , and one good thing is that you have added tracking of contact , but it also show daily wise , not like in 30 days you have contact with 8 person , whom 7 are in low risk and 1 is in high risk , please do daily wise update , then we can also track our activities . And avoid infection"
Tanushri Goel,"July 11, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,104,"Really wonderful app . It provides the updated information about the number of corona cases in india in world as well as in each state. The only problem about it is that it uses bluetooth connection which consumes a lot of battery. And also if you click on cough suppose it will change your category to ""at risk"" Overall it is fabulous ."
Arunava Das,"July 7, 2020",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,3,0,"Why is the most important information in the app displayed in a tiny scrolling Box? Is it that you want it to look like breaking news?

Krishna Kishore,"July 21, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,"The phukking part of this app is that it doesn't alert user when he is near to an infected or high risk individual. Even after contact it will not alert. It only shows when you get into another option of app. This will pose threat to whole family of the person who had came in contact with an infected person. So, dump the app into the assh whole of the developer and client."

And I was trying to find out the area by this app where I could infected. But there is nothing to help me. So I was thinking that this app is only to keep you updated with corona news that's it. If you want to contact me or you have any questions you may please come through the Arogya Setu installed in my cell."
Rohit Singh,"October 21, 2020",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,4,259,There is probably an issue in displaying the graph under 'COVID Updates' section. When trying to see the Daily graph for Recovered and Deceased Data. The graph area just blanks out.
Ashish Satpute,"July 16, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,419,"1) My neighbour is covid positive. And this app is saying I am safe. 2) You get delayed data of covid updates 3) Contact tracing is on the basis of number of people are using this app. But to be very honest, I don't carry my phone whenever I step down to buy essentials. Because in order to keep my phone working during this pandemic time, I want to avoid applying sanitizer on my phone frequently. I really don't understand the real use of this app so far. It's not solving the purpose."
Manmohan vij,"August 21, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,In my case app. Its showing that I came in contact with 2 high risk and 7 moderate risk persons. Now if you know about this why can't you share the phon No. of such persons so that I stop meeting such persons or visiting their office. This should have been of the inbuilt part of system. This is another example of illiterate persons handling such important app. It appears that improper data is being provided and authorities concerned are not concerned about our life. Horrible governance.
Srinath Rao Valpe,"July 11, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,1,"App is good. Have a suggestion. The user has to know, When is the exact time(they will know place) he came in contact with High risk people. So that, everyone will have idea of where to be and where not to be."

None of my contacts were contacted or notified after I got tested positive. Such a fake and flawed app, absolute waste and a big trouble for those who become positive once. Already the patient is going through so much stress, atleast this should be transparent and clearly communicated."
Ayushi Khatod,"July 31, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,26,"Worthless app, and very idiotic concept, with this app you cant even know whether you are secure or not. In 2 km area of my colony we have 15 positive cases and still showing safe for me and no positive cases showing and plus around 100 people's samples has been taken no mention of that. What is the use of this app if we do not get information. Improvement is required otherwise worthless investment and giving people false hope of being healthy."
Jitesh Singh,"July 25, 2020",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,5,1,"""A great step for mankind"" Although all the people require this application, I feel that making it more interesting for one to visit it regularly would be a great step. A SUGGESTION, A section for ""corona quiz"" can be added which would contain true facts and currently prevailing myths, and the user is supposed to answer as true or false and at the last he gets a score for the quiz. This would help spread awareness among the people and a feature to share the score would help share the app.😀"
Kolapati Ramakrishna,"November 20, 2020",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1,0,"No proper information provided for us. Useless.
